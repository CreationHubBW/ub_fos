            <h4>HISTORY &amp OVERVIEW OF DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h4>
			<p class="text-justify">One of the founder departments of the University of Botswana. It started as a department of Biology and changed to Biological Sciences in the 1993/94 academic year.</p><br />
            
            <p class="text-justify">The undergraduate programmes are aimed to provide sound basic training for students, and an MSc programme is available in Applied Microbiology. Graduate students can also register for MPhil and PhD research degrees; and an MSc programme in Applied Ecology is in preparation. MPhil and PhD degrees by research can be in any field of biology provided there is a suitably qualified staff member to supervise a prospective students. As Botswana is a relatively unexplored country in terms of its biological wealth, there is an almost unlimited potential for research in any field of biological sciences.</p><br />
            
            <p class="text-justify">The staff in the department of Biological Sciences have training in diverse range of research areas including botany, biochemistry, zoology , microbiology, and various specializations such as terrestrial ecology, freshwater ecology, wildlife biology, mycology, environmental microbiology, food microbiology, phycology, taxonomy, entymology, molecular biology, plant physiology, genetics, virology and bacteriology. The department offers both traditional biology courses such as Cryptogamic botany and very contemporary courses such as biotechnology.</p><br />
            
			<p class="text-justify">Staff members are encouraged to carry out research in their fields and their expertise is used in order to offer students a wide range of courses. The department is fully equipped to carry out research in the areas mentioned above.</p><br />
                
            
            <h4>MISSION</h4>
			<p class="text-justify">Train graduates to provide the biological components in ever aspect for national development through teaching and research, via collaboration with national and international instituions</p>
