Vice Chancellor, Professor Thabo Fako, has underscored the need for institutions of higher learning to work together across borders to promote cross-fertilisation of ideas and global knowledge to solve problems.
Professor Fako was speaking at the start of a three-day visit by a delegation from Lulea University of Technology (LUT) of Sweden to the University of Botswana on January 16, 2016. <!--more--> The delegation, hosted by the Department of Civil Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology, were in the country to seek partnership opportunities in areas of mining engineering, mineral engineering and geology. Against this background, Professor Fako emphasised the importance of institutions of higher learning working together across borders, arguing that confining one to national borders was a setback in the development of knowledge. He said collaboration between UB and LUT would strengthen their programmes. Professor Fako also enumerated a number of developments that UB had achieved, noting that in terms of infrastructure the University was not a third world institution.
In addition, he said UB staff was a mixture professionals from all over the world, therefore, making it an international institution. On the other hand, LUT Vice Chancellor, Professor John Sterte, appreciated the warm welcome they received. “We believe that there are a lot possibilities that we can work together on, in areas such as mining, mineral and geology,” he said. Professor Sterte was accompanied by Professors Par Weihed and Sven-Erik Soren Osterlund during the visit, which is a follow up to that of 17 Swedish Vice Chancellors who visited UB last year.
The aim was also to explore collaboration with UB in areas of mining engineering, mineral engineering and geology. UB Dean of Faculty of Health Science, Professor Yohana Mashalla, said in respect of health science, there were two possible areas of collaboration, namely Environmental Science and Environmental Health, given that Botswana had concentrated much on mining for too long. “We are focusing on putting on necessary strategies and programmes such as PhD in Nursing MPh, and PhD in Environmental Health to be able to train people who will be knowledgeable with skills to deliver in both areas of environmental health in the mining industry,” said Professor Mashalla.
The LUT delegation had opportunity to visit the Department of Mines and Chamber of Mines before wrapping up their visit with a mining excursion and dinner.
