The Faculty of Engineering and Technology at the University of Botswana will hold the first of its quarterly knowledge-sharing workshops on March 10, 2017 as part of a two year program funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) to improve the standard of engineering education at the University of Botswana and across the region by forging successful partnership between industry and engineering institutions which will enhance knowledge sharing and collaborative research among participating institutions. <!--more-->


**Is Paid ?** No.

#### Background
The program, which will be funded to the tune of £140,000 will perform this objective by
- partnering with local industry and regional higher education institutions, two of these in Botswana, by sharing knowledge through the placement of staff on industrial projects to learn and share knowledge; and, host industry professionals to provide guest lectures, seminars, professional development workshops, on campus – bring industry perspective to the academia, and targeted to students, staff and both staff and students.
 
- establishing and strengthening advisory boards for departments across the engineering faculty consisting of industry professionals, who will support the University in curriculum development and review, to ensure that engineering programmes are relevant to needs of industry and meet accreditation requirements of accreditation bodies.
 
- Working with five regional universities, two in Botswana being Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (BUAN) and Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST), as well as the National University of Lesotho (NUL), University of Swaziland (UNISWA) and the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Namibia to share experiences as the project unfolds and for them, the other institutions, to learn from the experiences of UB as the hub.

#### Activities
The four knowledge-sharing workshops will: share experiences industry experts have of teaching/workshopping students and staff at FET; share FET staff experiences post attachment to projects and their assessment of knowledge gaps and opportunities in industry; build mutual understanding between academia and practitioners and thus help shape future curricula and expand the use of industry experts in our departmental and faculty industrial advisory boards. Besides the workshops, FET technical staff knowledge/skills will be assessed and short term training/industry placement offered to close any gaps.
