**Is Paid ?** No.

The project is funded by Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and co-funded by OPEC Fund for International Development. ADA is the operating arm of the Austrian Development Corporation, and assists developing and transition countries with capacity building.
 
The main idea of the SOLTRAIN project is to encourage the roll‐out of thermal technology systems – both heating and cooling - to reduce strain on electricity grid systems in the mist of looming present and future blackouts and to reduce carbon footprints in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Universities and institutions in these countries share information and experiences to ensure the success of the project. The project is sponsored to the tune of 3, 400 000.00 EURO, of which 176, 575.00 EURO is dedicated to Botswana for the period of three years since March 1, 2016.
 
CERC is involved in the pursuit of research, teaching and advocacy in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency against the background of preserving the environment. This centre operates by embarking on project‐driven collaborations with local and international partners.
 
**Date**: March 7 – 9, 2017
 
**Venue**: University of Botswana Conference Centre
