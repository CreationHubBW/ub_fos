**Is Paid ?** No.

#### Background
Management of information resources keeps on changing as technology becomes the central focus in the stride towards knowledge-based economies. The way information is generated,  stored, accessed and used has changed to a point where, instead of immobile physical libraries and records management units, we now have pervasive library  and information systems where information can be accessed and utilized anywhere and anytime. Another trend transforming traditional information management is the emergence of integrated library and record keeping systems where information can be accessed from multiple information repositories anywhere and anytime. These developments have ensured that information and knowledge can easily be accessed and used in heterogeneous socio-economic establishments ubiquitously – solidifying the concept of the knowledge economy.

This conference will provide an excellent platform and opportunity for researchers, practitioners, academics, information scientists, innovators and research scholars to share their experiences in diverse aspects of records, information and knowledge management including innovation knowledge solutions. The conference will further provide an excellent interdisciplinary forum to discuss the most recent approaches, concerns and practical challenges at all stages of the information lifecycle in both developing and developed world contexts.
