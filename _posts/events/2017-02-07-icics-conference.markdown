The conference aims at continuing to share challenges and solutions to the continuing problems posed by Internet Based information Systems (especially Cyber Security issues); to share experiences and best practices


- On policy, strategy and regulatory framework addressing cyber-crime; to share experiences;
- On areas such as critical infrastructure - including the backbone, services and protection structures such as CERTs;
- On deployment of cyber-infrastructures and open data sharing for research and innovation.
- And to address cybersecurity capacity building and to stimulate discussions and interactions regionally and internationally around these areas.
- On the impact of cyber security on Organizational Information Systems


The conference will do this by bringing together stakeholders and delegates in workshops. The common running thread for the workshops' interactions and deliberations and outputs will also help feed into the development of a Model National Cybersecurity Strategy that could be used as a template by countries most of which will be represented from the region and the continent to build on.
