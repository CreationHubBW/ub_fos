The 2017/18 University of Botswana Student Representative Council (SRC) and Graduate Students Association (GSA) have promised to cultivate a mutually beneficial working relationship with the University executive management. <!--more-->


The 13 member SRC and eight-member GSA made the promise during a meeting to introduce members of the governing bodies to the executive management at UB on October 23, 2017. SRC President, Mr Oteng Eleck, together with his Vice President, Ms Refilwe Gaelesiwe, said they were looking forward to bridging the gap between the students and the University management.

Mr Eleck said they would introduce a number of initiatives and create a link between management and students underpinned by transparency, inclusiveness and student empowerment. Ms Gaelesiwe said they would try to remain apolitical and work as a unit to serve the demands of fellow students. She underscored the importance of abiding by the rules and doing everything guided by the constitution.

GSA Chairperson, Mr Moses Mogaekwa, advised the SRC members to act responsibly and to avoid anarchy when they wanted to be heard. Mr Mogaekwa said engaging in strikes should be the least of their options notwithstanding the challenges they faced as students. He observed that the aim of the GSA was to help drive research and innovation for UB to realise its mandate as an institution of higher learning that was responsive to society’s challenges and needs.

Deputy Vice Chancellor Students Affairs, Professor Martin Mokgwathi, dispelled the notion that there was bad blood between students and University management. On the contrary, Professor Mokgwathi said the aim was to give the students the best experience at UB through honest engagement and mutual understanding.

He said students’ problems affected management because they were responsible for both their welfare and academic pursuits. He called on the student leaders to always look for alternative ways and means of overcoming challenges.

Deputy Vice Chancellor Academic Affairs, Professor David Sebudubudu, also expressed the hope for a harmonious relationship anchored on consultation and team work. However, he expressed disappointment at some students who failed to attend classes because they ended up failing and repeating modules which he regretted was a high cost to government.

Professor Sebudubudu appealed to the student leaders to educate their fellow students on the importance of regularly attending classes, and that for one to graduate they would have satisfied all the requirements of a programme instead of the number of credits accumulated. He advised them to be proactive in addressing problems.

Deputy Vice Chancellor Finance and Administration, Mr Mendel Nlanda, also expressed the hope that the student leaders would keep their promise to act responsible and represent students well.

Summing up the submissions, Acting Vice Chancellor, Professor Kgomotso Moahi, commended the members of the student governing bodies for taking up the mantle of leadership. Professor Moahi said that was a sign of their unique ability and willingness to serve others and to make a difference in their lives.
