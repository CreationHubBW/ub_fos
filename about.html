                Today, more than ever before, Science has become central, even intertwined with economic
                development of countries and their citizens. This means that science has to keep evolving to keep up
                with changing national and world needs. This requires experts equipped with enough competencies
                and intelligence, to be able to steer the development of science and expertise, and help influence
                the opinion of professionals home and abroad. We hope that through our work, we will continue to
                contribute positively to advancement of this noble field.
