                <h2>Okavango Research Institute</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    The Okavango Research Institute (ORI) is an Institute for the study and conservation of one of the world's largest and most intact inland wetland ecosystems - the Okavango Delta- as well as other southern African wetlands, river basins, watersheds and surrounding dry lands. The research institute was founded in response of plans to use the Okavango for a large scale water supply programme.

                <h2>Centre for Scientific Reseach, Indigenous Knowledge &amp; Innovation (CESRIKI)</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    The main aim of CesrIKi from the onset was to bring researchers from various disciplines to carry out research on Indigineous Knowledge (IK). Our approach has always been multidisciplinary. It was realised that various discplines were operating on their own to understand various research questions and this defeated the idea of understanding issues from different angles (discplines). The university is organised into Departments and we hardly know what other researchers do and the idea of bringing researchers from various disciplines was regarded as a noble idea to break academic boundaries (silos).
